I clean my face with my normal routine /exfoliation, then apply the patch. I try to get the longest amount of use possible out of them, putting it on around 6-7pm and wearing it till the morning. I make sure that I lightly press the micro tips into the blemish, to ensure that it stays on but also to get the treatment into the skin. I have had breakouts disappear in 12hrs. Don’t pick at the breakout before hand. Make sure your skin is clean before applying them, if there is any oils you run the risk of it not sticking. I wouldn’t use these for everyday breakouts, just large ones that are tender or have a lot of swelling... these are the best.

One of these followed by a more basic hydrocolloid patch cuts the healing time down to three days, it’s absolutely insane.I will say if you’re expecting these to perform like a hydrocolloid patch, there are less pricy ones on the market. I like using these in conjunction with COSRX for the best results. If you’re looking to avoid salicylic acid like me, these are a great alternative to the Peace Out ones.

I had a dark red/purple spot from a zit that didn’t quite heal right (I was bad, I picked, I know). Just after one patch, it has lightened up a LOT. I am on to my third patch, and it is half the hue it started at, so I am fairly confident that by the 6th patch, it’ll be extremely lightened up, if not all the way gone. Also, after the first patch, the size of the dark spot shrank -- not by a lot, but by a decent amount. The sticker sometimes doesn’t stick all the way with the edges, so that’s why I am giving it only four starts, but it does stick on all day/night. I have worn mine for 6-8 hours during the day, and 8-9 hours during the night. I wake up and it’s still on. It could be because my spot is on the side of my nose, but like I said, not all of the edges stick on to the surface.

Unless you’re gonna shell out for plastic surgery- you have to have realistic expectations and have the grit to do a strict skincare routine every night and stick with it. Even then the most expensive lotions and serums are mostly preventative and help minimize the problems you have. I tried the dark spots one. They do exactly what they’re supposed to do. They soften and slightly lighten it. It makes it a little easier to cover with makeup. I hope people realize the blue one is for sunspots. Not acne scarring. It’s a different kind of “dark spot” I dunno- it’s a little pricey but pretty instant compared to the 100$ serums I’ve tried that barely budge it after months of useage. Also- the first night mine slipped - then I started putting it on before my other skincare and it stays fine.,,lightMedium,brown,normal,black,P442857,Focuspot Micro Tip Patches,Dr. Jart+,20.0

The patches don’t hurt at all, and they stick so well if you apply to clean skin. I do my skincare, then where the patch is going to lay, I apply rubbing alcohol with a cotton bud and let dry, then apply the patch. I would have given 4 stars, but the price being so high, and the end result not being spectacular knocked it down another.

56,24342757367,5,1.0,1.0,11,0,11,2021-03-14,"These work wonders for dark circles that are hereditary. Over time, they are lessened. What I do is wear them overnight (yes, they stay on thru the night) and remove in the morning. When I take them off, I look at them and if there is still product on them, I put them back in the tray (on the strips that protect the adhesive) and will use them again and again until the product has been completely used. I am able to use each set of patches anywhere between 3 and 6 times. I have tried them on “tired eyes” when my circles are prominent solely due to lack of sleep but I don’t get the same results. I think these are best for hereditary circles. They lighten them enough where it takes several years off my age (I’m nearly 40 and have been considering tear trough filler as a gift to myself to help with my circles which have been prominent since I was about 16). To see if they would work well for you, go in a room with good lighting and see if different angles make your circles disappear, if your circles are only visible in certain angles, these will help you. You will notice a difference after each use, but continued use will help lessen them each time. In my experience, the results seem to be lasting... but if they get worse due to lack of sleep, once I’ve caught up on sleep, they seem to need more work again. These patches used overnight and then followed up in the morning with an under eye brightener or concealer meant to use color correction for days circles tend to make hereditary circles vanish or barely visible. I don’t wear much makeup at all (my all over face “makeup” is just Dr Jart color correcting treatment (I have rosacea so it corrects my redness), no foundation, and I like the Becca under eye brightening corrector (but since that won’t be an option soon, I really like the Charlotte Tilbury magic vanish... the CT texture is amazing and works so well and is a great replacement).

I get a few cystic pimples from time to time and this is the only one that really penetrates them. Mostly because unlike the other ones- this one has little tiny tiny micro spikes (not painful) that get through to the pore. That means you end up using LESS patches than the others. The dots don’t bring the zit to the surface- they actually kind of dissipate it (because let’s be real- there’s no product that brings cystic zits to the surface and even if there was- i wouldnt want it).Usually I wake up with the patch cloudy and the zit is red but it seems to be less dense/painful and more in the healing process. I would say it’s better than when you try to pop a cystic zit and leave a huge hole in your face (which tends to be the case) or use several of the cheaper patches night after night to get the same result. Only negative I have is the packaging- the dots are on a film, in a plastic case, in a single use packet, in the bag.
